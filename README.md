- **NLP & GenAI**: Hugging Face, Ollama, Transformers, NLTK, spaCy
- **Specializations**: Time-series forecasting with Deep Neural networks, LightGBM, RandomForest, unstructured text analysis and topic modelling with Transformers, NLP and GenAI, data segmentation / anomaly detection with unsupervised learning methods

### 💼 What Makes Me Different
I am a Senior AI/ML Engineer leveraging 15+ years of experience designing data-intensive intelligent systems for high-stakes environments. I combine the mathematical rigor of a Quantitative Risk veteran with the creative drive of a Product Builder to engineer AI solutions that are as reliable and trustworthy as they are innovative.

I combine deep technical ability with the leadership experience to guide teams, manage cross-functional stakeholders, and translate complex technical concepts for C-suite executives. I am uniquely positioned to architect and build AI products that are not just powerful, but intuitive, commercially viable, and safe.

### 📊 Featured Projects
- **[Topic Modelling of Gym Reviews for Actionable Strategies](link)** Leveraged Transformer models like BERTopic, DistilBert as well as classical NLP methods (LDA) to draw insights from customer experiences of a global gym company, through their reviews online. Integrated an LLM (Phi-4) to distil information and generate solutions for the critical topics. 
- **[Student Drop-Out Prediction Model](link)** -Used XGBoost & Neural Networks to predict Student Dropout rates, Ultimately to assist the business with customer experience and retention, balancing resource utilisation. 
- **[Commodity Market Prediction Models](https://github.com/aydiny/mitsui-commodity-price-prediction))** - LSTM models to capture temporal patterns across commodity and equity features. Leveraged Random Forest for feature selection from a set of high dimensional set of engineered features.
- **[Optimal S&P Position Prediction Model](link)** - An ensemble LightGBM approach to estimate optimal market position. 
- **[Customer Segmentation](link)** - Unsupervised learning with K-means clustering, to optimize the marketing strategy of an e-commerce company. PCA and T-SNE views into the data
- **[Anomaly Detection](link)** - One-class SVM for monitoring a ship's engine to develop an early failure detection system

### 🎯 What I'm Looking For
A forward-thinking team in FinTech, HealthTech, or Enterprise AI to architect and ship the next generation of reliable, intelligent AI products.

### ⚡ Personal Interests
Visual arts and industrial design enthusiast, an amateur DIY'er , :tennis: player/fan . Music, novels and movies are essentials of life for me.
